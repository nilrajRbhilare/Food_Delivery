Build a frontend-only React application (‚ö†Ô∏è no backend, no database) for a food delivery platform. Use React state and JSON for temporary data handling.

‚úÖ Fix all JSX closing tag issues ‚Äî ensure every element and component is properly closed and the app compiles cleanly.

Navbar:

Include Logo, Search, Location Selector, Your Cart, and Track Order options.

Track Order Page:

Do not use dummy static data.

When a user places an order successfully, store that order information in a local JSON file or local state (simulated JSON).

Display order details such as order ID, items, total price (including delivery charges), date, and delivery status (e.g., Pending, On the Way, Delivered).

Data should automatically appear in the Track Order section after a successful order.

Your Cart Page:

Show selected items with price, quantity, and total.

Add delivery charges (e.g., ‚Çπ30) in the total amount calculation ‚Äî fix this issue if missing.

Rename ‚ÄúProceed to Checkout‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù.

When the user clicks Order, check whether the user is logged in:

If not logged in, open a Login/Register modal.

After successful login or registration, allow the user to proceed to payment.

Payment Page:

Show Total Amount (including delivery charges).

Add Coupon Field to apply valid discount codes (FOOD10, SAVE50, etc.) and update the total dynamically.

Display Payment Methods:

Cash on Delivery

UPI

Banking

After clicking Pay, show a popup message:

‚Äú‚úÖ Order Placed Successfully!‚Äù

Provide two options:

Order More ‚Üí navigates back to the food items page.

Track Order ‚Üí navigates to the Track Order page where the placed order details appear dynamically from the JSON storage.

üß© Requirements Summary:

No backend or database ‚Äî all data handled in React using state or JSON.

Include a Login/Register modal that controls access to ordering and payment.

Ensure navigation works via React Router.

Use clean, valid JSX with all tags properly closed.

Ensure delivery charges, coupon discounts, and order tracking updates function correctly.
