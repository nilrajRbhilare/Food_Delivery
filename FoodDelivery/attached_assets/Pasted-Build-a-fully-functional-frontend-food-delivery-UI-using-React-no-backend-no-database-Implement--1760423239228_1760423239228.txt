Build a fully functional frontend food delivery UI using React (no backend, no database). Implement all interactions using React state, props, and frontend logic only.

1️⃣ Navbar
Logo

Display a logo on the left.

Select Location

Input box where the user can type full address.

Include real-time map integration (Google Maps / Leaflet) to select address visually.

When the user selects a location on the map, update the address input automatically.

Show a dropdown of suggested addresses (use static list for now).

Search Bar

Input to search food items or restaurants.

Implement real-time filtering of food cards based on the search text.

Ensure search works across all categories dynamically on the frontend.

Offers

Display available offers in a dropdown or modal.

Each offer card should have “Apply Offer” button.

When clicked, apply the offer discount dynamically to the cart total (frontend only).

Your Cart

Show added food items in a cart dropdown/modal.

Include:

Item list (name, price, quantity)

Tax field (calculate dynamically based on cart total)

Coupon input (apply discount to total dynamically)

Proceed to Checkout button (show a modal saying “Checkout Successful” for frontend simulation)

2️⃣ Main Section
Filter Section

Filters to include:

Only Veg

Price range (e.g., < ₹100, ₹200, ₹500)

Fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop
