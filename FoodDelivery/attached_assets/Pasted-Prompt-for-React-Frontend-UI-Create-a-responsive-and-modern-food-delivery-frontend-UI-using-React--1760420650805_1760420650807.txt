Prompt for React Frontend UI:

Create a responsive and modern food delivery frontend UI using React (no backend, no authentication). The application should include the following sections and interactions:

1️⃣ Navbar

Include:

Logo on the left side.

Location Dropdown:

When the customer clicks, open a dropdown that allows them to:

Select current location (use a placeholder like “Use Current Location”).

Type full address manually.

See suggested saved addresses (like “Home”, “Work”).

Use a beautiful modal or dropdown with icons and smooth animation.

Search Bar in the center:

Customers can search any food item or restaurant.

Show live suggestions while typing (static list for now).

Offers link/button:

When clicked, open a section or modal showing current offer deals with attractive cards (discount %, food image, short description).

Sign In / Sign Up button:

When clicked, open a popup/modal with two tabs: Sign In and Sign Up forms (UI only, no backend).

Include smooth transitions and hover effects.

Cart Icon with item count badge:

When food is added, show it dynamically in the cart dropdown (title, price, quantity, total).

Use smooth slide-in animation for cart preview.

2️⃣ Main Section
Filter Bar

Add a filter section with toggle buttons and dropdowns for:

✅ Only Veg

💰 Price Range (less than ₹100, ₹200, ₹500, etc.)

📍 Nearby

⭐ Based on Ratings

🎁 Offers Available

💸 Cost (Low to High / High to Low)

Filters should update the displayed food cards dynamically (frontend-only).

Use icons and highlight active filters with color transitions.

Food Display Section

Create category-wise horizontal sections like:

🍜 Chinese

🍛 Indian

🍕 Pizza & Fast Food

🍦 Ice Creams

🍔 Popular Brands (McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, Domino’s, Subway, KFC)

🌱 Only Veg Restaurants

⭐ 5-Star Hotels / Premium Dining

Each section should have a horizontal scroll (carousel-style) with beautiful food cards.

Food Card Design

Each card should include:

Food Image

Restaurant Name

Rating (star icons)

Price

Offer Tag (if available)

“Add to Cart” button with hover animation

On clicking a food card:

Open a detailed modal/page showing:

Restaurant name

Rating

Price

Food description

“Add to Cart” button

Comment section (UI only) where user can type a comment

Use fade-in animation for modal.

3️⃣ UI / UX Requirements

Use modern, attractive design with:

Gradient backgrounds

Box shadows

Hover effects

Smooth transitions

Rounded cards and buttons

Fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile view.

Use Tailwind CSS or Styled Components for styling.

Use Framer Motion for animations (optional).

Keep layout clean, interactive, and visually appealing.

4️⃣ Additional Frontend Touches

Sticky Navbar while scrolling.

Add a “Back to Top” floating button.

Add a “Loading shimmer” effect when data loads.

Add light and dark mode toggle (optional).

Use icons from Lucide React or React Icons.

Output Expectation:

Deliver complete React frontend code for all the above.

No backend or API — use static arrays or dummy data for food, offers, and restaurants.

Make the UI polished, aesthetic, and fully responsive with animations and hover effects.
